## **Introduction**

SubScriptly is a React-based subscription management application that allows users to keep track of their various digital subscriptions. With features like adding and canceling subscriptions, notifications for upcoming payments, and organizing subscriptions into categories, SubScriptly provides a streamlined way to manage your subscriptions efficiently. The app interacts with a local `db.json` file to simulate API calls and data persistence.

## **Dependencies**

SubScriptly relies on the following dependencies:

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **json-server:** A full fake REST API to simulate data persistence using a local JSON file.
- **date-fns:** A lightweight library for handling date-related functionality, such as calculating days until a payment is due.
- **axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the local JSON server.

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install react json-server date-fns axios
```

## **Usage**

### **Adding a Subscription:**

- Users can add a subscription by filling out a form with the subscription name, category, payment date, and cost.
- The app will store this data in the local `db.json` file, simulating an API request.

### **Canceling a Subscription:**

- Users can cancel a subscription by selecting it from the list and clicking the 'Cancel' button.
- This will remove the subscription from the list and update the local data.

### **Notifications:**

- The app will notify users when a subscription payment date is approaching, helping them avoid missed payments.
- Notifications are generated based on the subscription data stored in `db.json`.

### **Categories & Search:**

- Users can organize their subscriptions into categories like movie apps and music apps.
- The search and filter functionalities allow users to quickly find specific subscriptions based on name, category, or payment date.
